# MinesweeperLearning
Learning to play Minesweepr with Neural Networks

## Game

The repo provides pyhton utils to generate, plot and play minesweeper games through code.

## Models

The repo also contains various model implementations, their trained weights, and general utilities to train minesweeper models.

See simple examples of the api use in [test.ipynb](test.ipynb)
